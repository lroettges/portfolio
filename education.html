        <h2>Washington University in St. Louis 2012-2016</h2>
        <p>I am a Junior double majoring in Applied Mathematics and Comparitive Arts with a minor in general Fine Arts. I have been involved in a number of groups on campus including Alpha Rho Chi (a professional-social fraternity for architecture and the allied arts), Stressbusters, the climbing club, and extensively in Student Union. Education is not just about the grade for me, but the experience and sense of fulfillment you get after understanding a challenging topic, completeing a large project, and trying something out of your comfort zone. WashU has allowed me to delve into topics and build relationships with different people that I otherwise would have never encountered. The primary reasons I decided to come to WashU were to experience a greater breadth of diversity and to have the chance at a cross curriculum education that allowed me to delve into various studies. I began as a dual degree student studying Mechanical Engineering and Fine Art. Were it not for the fluidity WashU allows between its schools, I would not have been able to figure out where I felt I fit best or discover some of my current interests, such as German and coding.</p>

        <h2>Study Abroad Summer 2014</h2>
        <p>I studied abroad at the Goethe language institute in GÃ¶ttingen, Germany for two months which were by far the most thrilling and wonderful moments of my life. I have sort of fallen in love with Germany, from the language, to the culture, to the beautiful geography. I was able to travel quite often and met some of my realatives for the first time. I also had the oportunity to celebrate in the streets of Berlin as Germany won the 2014 World Cup. I have kept up with my German studies through my Comparative Arts program at WashU and hope to go back to Germany at some point in my life, in effort to be bilingual and to spend more time with my relatives.</p>

        <h2>Pre-College Program 2012</h2>
        <p>I partook in a two week program at the Art Institute of Chicage for oil painting and drawing. This was a time for me to experiment and learn new painting techniques. I have since continued with oil painting and you can check out the <a href="./drawings&paintings.html">Drawing & Painting</a> portion of my website to see some of my work.</p>
