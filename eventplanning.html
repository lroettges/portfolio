        <h2>Large Scale Events</h2>
        <p>One of the largest events I have programmed is an Event called SUp All Night.  As the elected Vice President of Programming for Washington University in St. Louis's <a href="http://su.wustl.edu/">Student Union</a> (SU) I took on the role of lead coordinator for this 2014 fall event. SUp All Night is intended to showcase SU's various student groups to incoming freshman on the last Friday of fall orientation. There are over 2,000 attendees and over 75 student groups that take part in this event. The event features dance and singing performances, photo booths, free food, and various other activities.  Last year we even had CPR demonstrations and a group that brought in actual brain samples to display. I coordinated with the student groups, worked on the floor plan, organized signage, and developed a performance schedule, as well as co-coordinate with Building managers and cleaning services to ensure a smooth and successful event.</p>

        <h2>Advisor Programming Roles</h2>
        <p>In my position of VP of Programming I served as an advisor to some of our campus's largest programing bodies; particularly the <a href="http://spb.wustl.edu/">Student Programming Board</a> (SPB) and the school's four Class Councils. SPB brings in famous Comedians, organizes weekly Happy Hours, and throws a semesterly campus wide concert called WILD, which brings in over 5,000 people and big name artists. Class councils organize events tailored to their respective classes ranging from senior week, where seniors celebrate their last moments as undergraduates, to smaller events, such as providing subsidized tickets and transportation to movies and sports events. Though I don't directly program for the groups I help them utilize and be aware of their resources, run application processes to select board members, plan & provide retreats to teach them programming tools and rules, work with them on fleshing out their constitutions, and even occasionally help with day of programming. Additionally, I've lead a joint class council meeting for the various class councils to come together and program during the Halloween Season. I believe fostering a collaborative environment between programming bodies is important especially to reduce over-programming on campus. I also saw myself taking on the role as an avid listener who understands programming can be stressful. I strove to sympathize with any stressed out student who came to me with questions or with a problem that needed fixing, while also making sure they stick to their mission as a group and program within campus wide established rules.</p>

        <h2>Multi-Day Events</h2>
        <p>I was the primary program leader of the 2014 pre-orientation program called Student Union: Leading WashU Style. This is a four day program of nonstop events from early morning until late night. I lead 36 students, 16 of which were either foreign exchange or study abroad individuals, in a program that welcomes them not only to WashU, but also to the greater St. Louis Community. We went out to restaraunts, to City Museum, bowling, Forrest Park, on a community service trip, and on a tour of the city. We had student lead activities to teach how Student Union Advocates, Allocates, and Programs on campus. We had administrative pannels on topics such as Diversity & Inclusion, and did much more.
        Throughout the program students were encouraged to get involved on campus whether in SU or any of SU’s 350+ other student groups. Three members of the 2014 pre-o were elected to Freshman Class Council. Other pre-o students found ways to get involved through serving as Associative Justices in Constitutional Council, heading SU’s new recruitment and retention committee, singing in A Cappella groups, and playing in sports clubs, just to name a few. Their successes measure the success of the program. Though every program comes with some obstacles, the program was a overall a large success. Some of my responsibilities included: developing a four day program for students; coordinating & paying for all bussing, catering, and vendors; selecting and training all counselors; organizing all events & presentations; communicating with the first year students over summer; mandating all school and program rules; being accountable for the safety of all students within the program; etc.</p>

        <h2>Semi-formals</h2>
        <p>I have served on the social committee for Alpha Rho Chi (A nationally recognized professional-social Fraternity for Architecture and the Allied Arts) for two semesters and additionally served as the Worthy Estimator (aka treasurer) for another two.  During this time I oversaw and co-coordinated our chapter's first ever semi-formal as well as two other semi-formals in preceding semesters. Each year we have seen increased organization in our planning. Our first semi-formal was located in Holmes Lounge on campus, our second at Moonrise just around the corner, and our third at Old Orchid Gallery a bus ride away, so it is clear we are trying to formalize it more and more by disassociating it with the campus, since such an event is intended to offer students a fun way to get off campus and away from school work. I have worked with venues to organize contracts, invoices, and purchase orders; have helped coordinate buses and manage catering; and have acted as a sober contact as well as helped fundraise for our events. I have also been a part of many other smaller scale programs that we throw including movie and game nights. Programming can be very hands on and detail oriented, but overall I enjoy getting to make people happy and contributing to the holistic vision of these sorts of events.</p>

        <h2>Contributor Roles</h2>
        <p>As a sophomore I took on the role of External Vice President of the Sophomore Class Council. I assisted in a number of events including organizing a Sophomore Ski trip, organizing a movie premier event and movie themed dinner, and organizing an on campus ski rink and food event. Through these experiences my interest in programming began to grow and I learned a lot about the logistics and details that must go into planning a smoothly run event. My position focused on working with vendors to get contracts drawn up, organizing bussing, and assisting with all day of programming.</p>
