        <h2>Home</h2>
        <p>Though I currently live in St. Louis, MO while I attend school. My true home is back in Florida. I was born and lived for 10 years in Jacksonville, Florida until my family moved "over the ditch" (aka over the intercostal waterway) to Ponte Vedra Beach which is only about 35 minutes away. I love the beach and ocean and grew up swimming, surfing, fishing, kyaking, boogie-boarding, jr. lifegaurding, etc. Overall living in such an environment has shaped my love for adventure, my go-getter yet laid back attitude, and my apreciation for the environment. </p>

        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>My family is crazy, large, a bit neurautic, talented, and very entertaining. My sister is an artist, my brother is a doctor, and my parents are musicians, thus I have grown up in a very creative environment. I can connect with a number of people from varying backgrounds largely do to the breadth of personalities and interests within my family. I have 16 fiirst cousins who all like to travel to Florida on vacation during the summer, so I am used to overwhelming environments and understand they can be a lot of fun.</p>
