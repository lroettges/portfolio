        <p>My family is crazy, large, a bit neurautic, talented, and very entertaining. My sister is an artist, my brother is a doctor, and my parents are musicians, thus I have grown up in a very creative environment. I can connect with a number of people from varying backgrounds largely do to the breadth of personalities and interests within my family.
